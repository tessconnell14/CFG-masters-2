This repo contains the group data analysis of Fran, Tess and Rumbie.

ðŸ“Š Using our cleaned data we preprocessed the data, conducted univariate and bivariate analysis and tested our hypotheses:
1. The higher the education level, the more you get paid
2. People from traditional routes get paid more than those from non-traditional
3. The more years you have worked, the more you will get paid
4. Developers in different industries get paid differently
5. People from non-traditional routes will find it harder to get a job

We also investsigated correlation between 'YearsCodePro' and 'WorkExperience' and visualised our findings using pandas.

Assignment requirements:
Task 1: Build upon the EDA from Week 1 to conduct a more detailed Explanatory Data
Analysis
Task 2: Identify several hypotheses related to your problem based on your EDA, and
perform appropriate statistical tests
Task 3: Investigate potential correlations in the dataset, explaining what each correlation
means in the context of your problem
Task 4: Translate your analytical insights into potential solutions or recommendations
